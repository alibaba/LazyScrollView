LazyScrollView is an iOS ScrollView , to resolve the problem of reusability of views. 

We reply an another way to control reuse in a ScrollView, it depends on give a special reuse identifier to every view controlled in LazyScrollView.

Comparing to UITableView , LazyScrollView can easily create different layout , instead of the single row flow layout. 

Comparing to UICollectionView , LazyScrollView can create views without Grid layout , and provides a easier way to create different kinds of layous in a ScrollView .

The system requirement is iOS 5+

> We create a modular UI solution for building native page dynamically based on `LazyScrollView`, you can see more info from this repo : [https://github.com/alibaba/tangram-ios](https://github.com/alibaba/tangram-ios)

# Installation

LazyScroll is available as `LazyScroll` in cocoapods 

```
   pod 'LazyScroll'
```

If you don't want to use cocoapods, you can also manually add the files in `LazyScrollView` folder into your Xcode project

# Usage

    #import "TMMuiLazyScrollView.h"
    
 Then , create LazyScrollView  
 
```objectivec
TMMuiLazyScrollView *scrollview = [[TMMuiLazyScrollView alloc]init];
scrollview.frame = self.view.bounds;
```

next implement`TMMuiLazyScrollViewDataSource`
 
```objectivec
@protocol TMMuiLazyScrollViewDataSource <NSObject>
@required
//number of item om scrollView
- (NSUInteger)numberOfItemInScrollView:(TMMuiLazyScrollView *)scrollView;
//return view model (TMMuiRectModel) by index 
- (TMMuiRectModel *)scrollView:(TMMuiLazyScrollView *)scrollView rectModelAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
//return view by the unique string that identify a model(muiID) . You should render the item view here. And the view is probably . Item view display. You should always try to reuse views by setting each view's reuseIdentifier and querying for available reusable views with dequeueReusableItemWithIdentifier:
- (UIView *)scrollView:(TMMuiLazyScrollView *)scrollView itemByMuiID:(NSString *)muiID;
@end
```

next , set datasource delegate of LazyScrollView

```objectivec
scrollview.dataSource = self;
```

finally , do reload

```objectivec
[scrollview reloadData];
```
